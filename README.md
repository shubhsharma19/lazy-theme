## Lazyvim theme for VS Code ✨

I was in love with how **lazyvim setup for neovim** looks and feels so I tried to install a theme inspired by lazyvim on vscode, found no theme, so I made my own.

This theme is inspired from **lazyvim setup** for **neovim**. ✨

## How to download 
1. Go to vscode
2. Go to extensions tab
3. Search "lazyvim"
4. Install the theme
5. Enjoy the beauty
